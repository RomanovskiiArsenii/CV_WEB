Designed and developed personal portfolio website showcasing skills, experience, contact details and certifications.

Implemented user-friendly UI. Ensured seamless adaptability and responsiveness across multiple mobile devices. Looks best on desktop.

Used HTML and CSS to create the initial design and layout. The project is currently being used as part of an ongoing learning process in HTML and CSS. 
Future enhancements and functionality improvements are planned for learning JavaScript. The site is hosted and version controlled on GitHub.

Conceptualised and implemented the design of the website from scratch. Designed layouts, colour schemes and visual elements to reflect personal style.

The site contains several large images which can take a long time to load on a poor internet connection. 
However, as they are an important part of the design, I decided to keep them.

A browser won't allow an intro audio until you return to the main page from a secondary page. 
(such as certificates). This is the policy of all major browsers.

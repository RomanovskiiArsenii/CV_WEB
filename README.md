# cv
This website showcases my CV.

Adapted to different screen sizes, looks best on desktop. Designed as an example WEB project.
Right now, I am unfamiliar with JavaScript and have only a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.
As I progress through HTML CSS and JavaScript, I will make improvements and expand the site.

The site contains several big images, which can take a long time to load on a poor Internet connection. 
Despite this, I made the decision to maintain them as they are a crucial component of the design.

The browser won't allow the intro audio until you return to the main page from a secondary page 
(such as certificates). This is the policy of all major browsers.

You can check out the side project by clicking the link "Ask Jake" at the footer.

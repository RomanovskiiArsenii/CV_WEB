# cv
This website showcases my CV.

Adapted to different screen sizes, looks best on desktop. Designed as an example WEB project.
Right now, I am unfamiliar with JavaScript and have only a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.
As I progress through HTML CSS and JavaScript, I will make improvements and expand the site.

The site contains several big images, which can take a long time to load on a poor Internet connection. 
Despite this, I made the decision to maintain them as they are a crucial component of the design.

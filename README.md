Personal CV Website

Developed and designed a personal portfolio website showcasing information,  skills, work experience, contact details, and certifications.

Implemented a user-friendly interface. Ensured seamless adaptability and responsiveness for various mobile devices. Looks best on desktop.

Utilized HTML and CSS to construct the initial design and layout. The project is currently a part of ongoing learning in HTML and CSS. 
Future enhancements and functionality improvements are planned for JavaScript learning. The website is hosted and version-controlled on GitHub.

Conceptualized and executed the design of the website from scratch. Designed layouts, color schemes, and visual elements to reflect personal style.

The site contains several big images, which can take a long time to load on a poor Internet connection. 
Despite this, I made the decision to maintain them as they are a crucial component of the design.

A browser won't allow an intro audio until you return to the main page from a secondary page 
(such as certificates). This is the policy of all major browsers.
